# GRender

GRender is an utility that wraps ImGui, ImPlot and other OpenGL features for a quick graphical interface design. At current state, it works under Windows, Linux and (I don't test in awhile) MacOS.


## Template

Template contains all the necessary information to get any project started. It uses some of the main features available in the package.
