# GRender

GRender is an utility that wraps ImGui, ImPlot and other OpenGL features for a quick graphical interface design. At current state, it works under Windows, Linux and (I don't test in awhile) MacOS.


## Template

An old polymer prototype that I extended to show some features available and how one can use GRender. Under the hood, it creates a Gaussian chain and batch spheres and cylinders using OpenGL.
